 ○
 ○
 Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on 
theorem
 and used for solving classification problems.
 It is mainly used in 
Bayes 
text classification
 that includes a high-dimensional training 
dataset.

 Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification 
algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make 
quick predictions
How Do Naive Bayes Algorithms Work?
 Let’s understand it using an example. Below I have a training data set of weather and corresponding target variable ‘Play’ (suggesting 
possibilities of playing). Now, we need to classify whether players will play or not based on weather condition. Let’s follow the below 
steps to perform it.
 1. Convert the data set into a frequency table
 In this first step data set is converted into a frequency table
 2. Create Likelihood table by finding the probabilities
 Create Likelihood table by finding the probabilities like Overcast probability = 0.29 and probability of playing is 0.64
